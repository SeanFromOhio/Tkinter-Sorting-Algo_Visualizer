# Tkinter-Sorting-Algo_Visualizer

# Description:
- A clean GUI that allows the user to generate random arrays of varying sizes and magnitude, and run 4 different sorting algorithms with associated visuals in order to develop
a better understanding of how the algorithms work.
- This project allowed me to learn about building GUIs (and see the resemblances to building wed apps), as well as to continue to develop my understanding of these sorting 
algos. 

# Technologies:
- Python, Tkinter, Ttk (modern styling)

# Algorithms Implemented:
- Bubble Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
